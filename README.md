### Author: Fuyao Li

## Requirementï¼š
Create a simple python application containerized with a dockerfile. The goal here is to both demonstrate running your application within a docker container (using docker run terminal commands) but to also build a docker image in your CI/CD pipeline which will be pushed to Docker Hub or other container management service.

## Set up:
1. Clone the repository:
``` shell
git clone git@github.com:nogibjj/Mini_Proj12_Fuyao_Li.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment
``` shell
conda create --name test python=3.9
conda activate test
```
3. Install required packages
``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Application within a Docker Container
1. `make build`:
![build](fig/make_build.png)

2. `make run`:

**The Flask app will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.**


## Build Docker Image
1. docker login:
`docker login`

2. `make push`:
![build](fig/make_push.png)


## Web Application Description
This is a simple Flask-based web application for selecting and managing a list of cars based on predefined options for car brand, year, and mileage. Users can add cars to their selection and remove them as needed. The app is fully interactive and runs on a web browser.
